## Introduction

This repository contains automated tests for a web application using Cypress. The tests are organized using the Page Object Model (POM) approach to enhance code reusability and maintainability.

## Features

- End-to-end testing using Cypress
- Organized test code using Page Object Model (POM)
- Supports different environments and configurations
- Easy to extend with new test cases
- Real-time reporting with Cypress dashboard

## Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RuhulAminDSi/CypressPOM.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd CypressPOM
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Open Cypress Test Runner:**
   After the installation, run:
   ```bash
   npx cypress open
   ```
   This will open the Cypress Test Runner where you can run your test cases.

## Usage

- To run all tests in headless mode (e.g., for CI/CD pipelines):
  ```bash
  npx cypress run
  ```
- To run a specific test:
  ```bash
  npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/pom.cy.js"
  ```

## Folder Structure

The folder structure of this project follows the best practices for Cypress and POM:

```bash
CypressPOM/
├── cypress/
│   ├── e2e/                   # Test files
│   ├── fixtures/               # Test data (JSON files)
│   ├── support/
│   │   ├── PageObjs/           # Page Object Model files
│   │   ├── commands.js         # Custom Cypress commands
│   │   └── index.js            # Global configurations and behavior
├── cypress.config.js           # Cypress configuration file
├── package.json                # Project dependencies and scripts
└── README.md                   # Project documentation
```

## Writing Tests

- All test cases are written in the `cypress/e2e/` directory.
- The Page Object Model files are stored in the `cypress/support/PageObjs/` directory, making the test code reusable and maintainable.
  
Example test:

```javascript
describe('Sample Test', () => {
    it('should visit the homepage and check the title', () => {
        cy.visit('/');
        cy.title().should('include', 'Home');
    });
});
```
